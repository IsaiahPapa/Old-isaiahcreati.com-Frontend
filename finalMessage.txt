Well, its sad to see it go, but im happy there is a new home for the site at the "bot" subdomain. The react frontend is super sick, and easy to develop.
I wanted to upload this repo because I spent around a year working on this. Most of this was learning.
The website was not even suposed to be put into production, people just started using it, then more, then more, then more.
It was really just fixing stability stuff 24/7 but I learned a LOT with pushing it to production.
All this stuff helped me rewrite everything in react, and redid the backend in nodejs/typscript.

GGS, it as fun. 
onto better avenues. Nah fr fr I just wanna rewrite this in react and put up a real page.
