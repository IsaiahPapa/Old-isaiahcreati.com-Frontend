                                    I originally made this site for my viewers to access stream resources as I started to juice StreamElements and Streamlabs to their full extent.
                                    After raiding, hosting, and chatting with people inside the Twitch community, and then waiting for StreamElements or Streamlabs to create a system I got tired. I took it into my own hands.
                                    I created system that allows other Twitch streamers to hook up Channel Points with Text-to-Speech, Custom Sounds, Notifications, and more (coming soon).
                                    <br><br>
                                    If you are looking to set up Text to Speech or custom sounds with your Twitch Channel Points redeemables, sign in with Twitch in the top right.
                                    It will ask you to authenticate with your Twitch account (this allows me to access your Channel Point rewards, otherwise im hopeless), click your profile image on the top right, then click the Dashboard button (or click <a href="/dashboard" target="_blank">here</a>), and begin setting up your rewards!.
                                    <br><br>

                                        After pressing the "Join Channel" button, the bot should join your channel. <b class="alert-danger">DONT BAN THE BOT.</b> Now you want to find the "Bind Reward" buttons. There is going to be one button per "Module". 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Go ahead and press the "Bind TTS" button (press the one you want). A dialog will appear. 
                                        Press the "Bind" button and then three little loading dots will appear. These will go away once you redeem a request. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        So, go over to YOUR chat on the right hand side of the <a href="/dashboard" target="_blank">dashboard</a> page, choose the item you want to bind to Text to Speech, and then send the message in chat. 
                                        If it was a success, the three loading dots should have disappeared and there should be a SUCCESS message on the button. You can now close this box. If you want to bind Sounds, just follow the process again. 
                                        I tried to make it as seamless as possible.

                                    There are two systems behind the scenes that are used to generate a Text-to-Speech method. The first one is free and requires no setup, but the voices sound... <em>strange</em>.
                                    The second one is free for a year <strong>IF</strong> you meet the requirements after that charges may apply, requires you to create an account on AWS, but the voices are like the ones you are used to.
                                    If you want to use this method, follow the steps below then message me when you have your keys. I am working on a person-to-person basis, so sorry if I take a while.
                                </p>
                                <p>To synthesize a TTS/Text-to-Speech message, we must use an engine. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS) Free Tier</a> offers a service called Amazon Polly. We will use the Amazon Polly engine to synthesize our messages. You just need to provide me with two keys so I can generate the messages.</p>
